# About
Welcome! This public repository contains the source code for my personal website hosted at [mharryowen.com](https://www.mharryowen.com).

The site's frontend is built in Vue 3; the old version, built in Nuxt 3, is now deprecated. I decided to forego Nuxt's incredible DX for this 1.0 version in favor of a source bundle that's overall lighter and more ergonomic.

What does the future hold? I'm very encouraged by the forthcoming View Transitions meta, and I'm currently considering a future iteration of this site built without a JS framework.

Feel free to get in touch with any questions! Cheers, and thanks for stopping by.
